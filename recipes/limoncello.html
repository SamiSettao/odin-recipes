    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 lemons</li>
        <li>500 ml pure grain alcohol</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a vegetable peeler, peel the lemons. When peeling each lemon, try to remove only the outer yellow skin and avoid the white pith as much as possible. If your lemon peels have some pith, trim the pith away with a paring knife. But it does not have to be perfect.</li>
        <li>Transfer the lemon peels to a lidded jar, big enough to fit the 500mL of alcohol (or more if using). Pour the alcohol over the lemon peels, cover, and store in a cool, dry place for about 30 days. The longer you let the lemons infuse the alcohol, the better it taste.</li>
        <li>After 30 days elapsed, prepare the simple syrup.  In a small saucepan, mix together the sugar and the water.  Bring the water to a simmer and stir until the sugar dissolves.  Once dissolved, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool.  </li>
        <li>While the simple syrup is cooling, strain the alcohol.  Line a strainer with cheesecloth (or a coffee filter), and set it over a bowl or jar big enough to hold all the liquid.  Strain the infused alcohol through the filter.  You may need to strain it once or twice to get the little particles of leftover lemon peel out.  </li>
        <li>Once strained, pour the simple syrup into the infused alcohol and stir gently to mix.  Taste and adjust the sugar if desired</li>
        <li>Bottle the limoncello into jars, and store in the fridge or freezer.  The limoncello can last in the freeze for up to a year (maybe longer). </li>
    </ol>

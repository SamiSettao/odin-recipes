    <h3 class="heading">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large, low-moisture whole milk mozzarella ball approximately 160z</li>
        <li>High-heat oil (as needed)</li>
        <li>Flour (as needed)</li>
        <li>2 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons of fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of dried basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the mozz into sticks - about 2 inches long by 1/2 inch thick, or nuggets of desired size.  If the mozzarella is breaking apart, stick it in the freezer until it gets firm. </li>
        <li>Add your breadcrumbs to a bowl along with the parsley, basil, oregano, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and salt.  Mix until fully combined.  Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. </li>
        <li>Set up your breading station with flour, egg, and breadcrumbs.  Bread each mozz stick in the following order: flour, egg, panko, egg, panko.  Once breaded, place them on a parchment lined rimmed baking sheet.  Transfer the baking sheet to to the fridge for at least a half an hour allowing the mozz sticks to set. </li>
        <li>Add about a half an inch of oil in a skillet, and heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 350ยบ.  You want to shallow fry the mozz stick, not fully submerge and deep fry them.  Once hot, fry the mozz sticks in batches for about 1 to 2 minutes per side until they're golden, brown, and delicious.  </li>
        <li>Once done, remove each mozz stick and transfer to a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet (or paper towel lined plate) and immediately season with a touch of salt.  </li>
        <li>Pair with your favorite pomodoro sauce</li>
    </ol>
